What is a Jenkins Freestyle Project?
Jenkins Freestyle Project is a repeatable build job, script, or pipeline that contains steps and post-build actions. It is an improved job or task that can span multiple operations. It allows you to configure build triggers and offers project-based security for your Jenkins project. It also offers plugins to help you build steps and post-build actions.
